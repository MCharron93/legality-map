        <p>The new legislation, Senate Bill 226, was sponsored by Republican Senator Arthur Orr at the beginning of
          February 2016. And within a few months, the bill passed on May 4th, 2016. Then, a few days later, on May
          10th,
          2016, Alabama State Governor Robert Bentley signed the legislation into law.
          <br>
          The bill itself states:

          “New synthetic substances are being created which are not controlled under the provisions of existing state
          law
          but which have a potential for abuse similar to or greater than that for substances controlled under
          existing
          state law. These new synthetic substances are called ‘synthetic controlled substances or synthetic
          controlled
          substance analogues’ and can be designed to produce a desired pharmacological effect and to evade the
          controlling statutory provisions. Synthetic controlled substances or synthetic controlled substance
          analogues
          are being manufactured, distributed, possessed, and used as substitutes for controlled substances.”

          And it goes on to list mitragynine and hydroxymitragynine (sic) within the bill for synthetic substances.
          However, neither mitragynine nor 7-hydroxymitragynine is a synthetic compound. Both are naturally occurring
          alkaloids found in the kratom plant. Still, even though kratom compounds are not synthetic, the state law
          continues to view kratom products and the plant as an illegal substance in Alabama at this time. The
          addition
          of
          both molecules added onto the bill cements the ban.
