              Senate Bill 226</a>, was sponsored by Republican Senator Arthur Orr at the beginning of
            February 2016. And within a few months, the bill passed on May 4th, 2016. Then, a few days later, on May
            10th,
            2016, Alabama State Governor Robert Bentley signed the legislation into law.
          </p>
          <p>
            The bill itself states:
          </p>
          <p class="ital-text">
            “New synthetic substances are being created which are not controlled under the provisions of existing state
            law
            but which have a potential for abuse similar to or greater than that for substances controlled under
            existing
            state law. These new synthetic substances are called ‘synthetic controlled substances or synthetic
            controlled
            substance analogues’ and can be designed to produce a desired pharmacological effect and to evade the
            controlling statutory provisions. Synthetic controlled substances or synthetic controlled substance
            analogues
            are being manufactured, distributed, possessed, and used as substitutes for controlled substances.”
          </p>
          <p>
            And it goes on to list mitragynine and hydroxymitragynine (sic) within the bill for synthetic substances.
            However, neither mitragynine nor 7-hydroxymitragynine is a synthetic compound. Both are naturally occurring
            alkaloids found in the kratom plant. Still, even though kratom compounds are not synthetic, the state law
            continues to view kratom products and the plant as an illegal substance in Alabama at this time. The
            addition
            of
            both molecules added onto the bill cements the ban.

          <p>The Arkansas Department of Health was notified by Dr. Thomas Atkinson, M.D., from the Springdale Treatment
            Center in Springdale, AR, that patients at the addiction treatment center had used kratom before. He
            informed the Department of Health that kratom exhibits an opiate agonist action in subjects. He issued a
            warning about kratom because he believed the products shouldn’t be available to get bought by Arkansas
            citizens at local businesses. After hearing the doctor’s argument, the health department decided to take the
            matter into its own hands.

            a public hearing on September 1st, 2015, where public comments were allowed on the subject. But when the
            comment period had expired, the Department of Health did not receive any public comments on the topic. So,
            the proposed bill went into effect on February 1st, 2016.

          <p>The legislators in Indiana introduced <a href="http://iga.in.gov/legislative/2014/bills/senate/305"
              target="_blank">Senate Bill 305</a> at the beginning of
            2014. The bill was authored by
            three Republican Senators: James Merritt, Ronnie Alting, and Brent Steele. It also had two other senators,
            Republican Senator Joseph Zakas and Democratic Senator Lonnie Randolph, to help co-author the measure. The
            proposed legislation became effective on July 1st, 2014.
          </p>
          <p>
            The bill listed both mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine under a section labeled as “Synthetic Drugs.” And
            for the proposal, it defined synthetic drugs as “a substance containing one (1) or more of the following
            chemical compounds, including an analog of the compound.”
          </p>
          <p>
            But, as we all know, kratom is a naturally occurring tree in the rainforests of Southeast Asia. There’s
            nothing synthetic about either molecular compound. Nevertheless, the wording on the bill has not been
            amended to reflect the truth. So, to this day, Indiana state law still looks at the alkaloids in kratom as
            synthetic substances per the wording in the bill.

            signed into law by the governor on June 27th, 2017. However, the introduction of the bill went before the
            legislators without any kratom alkaloids listed on it. But the Director of Health sent a notice to the
            Secretary of State to add mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine to the Controlled Substances Act behind

            the measure, the Kratom Consumer Protection Act, in February 2019. But by March 2019, the House Committee
            on Health, Education, and Welfare recommended to hold the measure back for further scientific study. They
            tried again in January 2020. But the same thing happened.

              Senate Bill 2687</a>, to the Senate Judiciary on February 27th, 2020. But so far, no action has been
            taken on
            the bill. So we’ll have to wait and see where it goes.
