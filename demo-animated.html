                Senate Bill 226</a>, was sponsored by Republican Senator Arthur Orr at the beginning of
              February 2016. And within a few months, the bill passed on May 4th, 2016. Then, a few days later, on May
              10th,
              2016, Alabama State Governor Robert Bentley signed the legislation into law.
            </p>
            <p>
              The bill itself states:
            </p>
            <p class="ital-text">
              “New synthetic substances are being created which are not controlled under the provisions of existing
              state
              law
              but which have a potential for abuse similar to or greater than that for substances controlled under
              existing
              state law. These new synthetic substances are called ‘synthetic controlled substances or synthetic
              controlled
              substance analogues’ and can be designed to produce a desired pharmacological effect and to evade the
              controlling statutory provisions. Synthetic controlled substances or synthetic controlled substance
              analogues
              are being manufactured, distributed, possessed, and used as substitutes for controlled substances.”
            </p>
            <p>
              And it goes on to list mitragynine and hydroxymitragynine (sic) within the bill for synthetic
              substances.
              However, neither mitragynine nor 7-hydroxymitragynine is a synthetic compound. Both are naturally
              occurring
              alkaloids found in the kratom plant. Still, even though kratom compounds are not synthetic, the state
              law
              continues to view kratom products and the plant as an illegal substance in Alabama at this time. The
              addition
              of
              both molecules added onto the bill cements the ban.

            <p>The Arkansas Department of Health was notified by Dr. Thomas Atkinson, M.D., from the Springdale

              informed the Department of Health that kratom exhibits an opiate agonist action in subjects. He issued a
              warning about kratom because he believed the products shouldn’t be available to get bought by Arkansas
              citizens at local businesses. After hearing the doctor’s argument, the health department decided to take
              the
              matter into its own hands.
            </p>
            <p>

                target="_blank">Senate Bill 305</a> at the beginning of
              2014. The bill was authored by
              three Republican Senators: James Merritt, Ronnie Alting, and Brent Steele. It also had two other
              senators,
              Republican Senator Joseph Zakas and Democratic Senator Lonnie Randolph, to help co-author the measure.
              The
              proposed legislation became effective on July 1st, 2014.
            </p>
            <p>
              The bill listed both mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine under a section labeled as “Synthetic Drugs.”
              And
              for the proposal, it defined synthetic drugs as “a substance containing one (1) or more of the following
              chemical compounds, including an analog of the compound.”
            </p>
            <p>
              But, as we all know, kratom is a naturally occurring tree in the rainforests of Southeast Asia. There’s
              nothing synthetic about either molecular compound. Nevertheless, the wording on the bill has not been
              amended to reflect the truth. So, to this day, Indiana state law still looks at the alkaloids in kratom
              as
              synthetic substances per the wording in the bill.

        <h3>What is Kratom?</h3>
        <p>
          Mitragyna speciosa, commonly known as “kratom,” is a tropical evergreen plant native to Southeast Asian
          countries.The trees are indigenous to countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. The surrounding
          countries and
          provinces in the region
          are also home to the native species. All of those territories provide the much-needed climate and
          environmental
          conditions that are necessary for the plant to thrive in the wilderness.
        </p>
        <p>
          The leaves of a kratom tree were used for generations by rural peasants in that section of the globe as an
          herbal remedy to battle pain, fatigue, diarrhea, and as a substitute for opium. We also find it was used by
          natives in religious ceremonies and to relax after working in the uncompromising heat outside on the farms.

          The kratom leaves in their raw form have been used in traditional medicine in its native regions
          for hundreds of years. Now, kratom is becoming popular in modern western society for its various effects, as
          well as providing some users relief from certain complaints. Health professionals have expressed concerns
          about the leaf being marketed as a “medicinal treatment” because its effects and potential applications have
          yet to be clinically tested, and it is not approved or regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
          The pharmacology research that exists on kratom isn’t comprehensive, but some users have reported short-term
          improvements to their quality of life.
        </p>
        <p>
          But even though the tree’s leaves were known as a folk remedy to inhabitants in the area for centuries, it
          never gained any traction in western civilization until Peter Willem Korthals—a botanist with the Dutch East
          India Service—discovered its existence in 1839. Korthals originally coined the tree with the name Stephegyne
          speciosa. The scientific name and classification went through several iterations throughout the years until
          George Darby Haviland, a British surgeon, gave it the name in 1859 that we still know it as today: Mitragyna
          speciosa.

          The plant would soon fade into obscurity afterward until we see a resurgence of interest in the alkaloids
          found inside the plant at the beginning of the 21st century, played in part by the ongoing opioid epidemic
          prevalent in American culture.

          </h3>
          In short, the Kratom Consumer Protection Act, also known as the KCPA, is a piece of legislation that allows
          consumers access to legal Kratom whilst mitigating the market and reducing the sale of unregulated,
          dangerous,
          harmful Kratom products. The intention of the act is to ensure only approved Kratom is sold and distributed
          amongst the market. It also aims to stop the complete ban on Kratom by protecting its users and disproving
          the
          myths, rumors, and misconceptions about the natural product.

          The act concentrates on important information about the product, including its definition, the regulations
          on
          doses, and the prohibition of dangerous sales. It also moves for the requirement of Kratom vendors, creators
          and sellers to have specific, informative labels on all products containing Kratom. This was they can stay
          within the parameters of the FDA. Finally, it pushes for the department of agriculture and food to create
          and
          enforce standards within the growing and production of Kratom.
